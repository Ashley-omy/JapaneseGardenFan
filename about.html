                    <section>
                        <p><strong>Japanese gardens</strong> are known for their <strong>tranquility</strong>,
                            <strong>balance</strong>, and <strong>natural beauty</strong>, embodying principles of
                            <strong>harmony</strong> and <strong>simplicity</strong>.
                        </p>

                        <p>They often feature:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Stone pathways</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Koi ponds</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Wooden bridges</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Carefully pruned trees</strong></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>These elements create a <strong>serene environment</strong> that reflects the
                            <strong>changing seasons</strong>.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Water elements</strong>, such as small <strong>waterfalls</strong> or
                            <strong>ponds</strong>, symbolize <strong>purity</strong> and <strong>life</strong>, while
                            <strong>rocks</strong> and <strong>sand</strong> represent <strong>stability</strong> and
                            <strong>eternity</strong>.
                        </p>

                        <p>Unlike <strong>Western-style gardens</strong>, which focus on <strong>symmetry</strong>,
                            <strong>Japanese gardens</strong> embrace <strong>asymmetry</strong> and <strong>natural
                                flow</strong>, making them feel like a <strong>miniature representation of
                                nature</strong>.

                            <p>
                                The video begins with serene piano music playing in the background, as beautiful, lush
                                green Japanese gardens come into view. The camera gently pans across moss-covered
                                stones, carefully trimmed shrubs, and a quiet pond reflecting the surrounding trees. The
                                scene conveys a peaceful, harmonious atmosphere.

                                After a few moments, the screen transitions to an indoor setting where a male narrator
                                appears. He begins to speak in a calm and informative tone, introducing the philosophy
                                and design principles behind Japanese gardens.

                                A few seconds after the narrator begins to speak, text appears in the upper right corner
                                of the screen. It reads: "Joshua Minier, PhD – Shizen Style". The text remains visible
                                for several seconds before fading out, providing viewers with the name and credentials
                                of the speaker.

                                the narrator says:"NIWA, or Japanese garden, actually means pure place. It's meant to
                                represent a pure and beautiful place that you can always come to, regardless of what
                                chaotic things are going on in the world, or what your busy life is like. And it's not
                                an escape, but it's more of a place to recenter and refresh."

                                The scene transitions to a traditional Japanese house, focusing on a wooden corridor
                                that opens onto an inner courtyard. In the center lies a beautifully maintained
                                karesansui (dry landscape) garden. Several carefully pruned trees and sparsely planted
                                shrubs are arranged in perfect balance. The gravel covering the ground is meticulously
                                raked into flowing patterns, designed to represent rippling water stirred by the
                                wind.The name “

                                the narrator says:"According to Japanese art specialist Dr Lennox Tierney, there are
                                seven Zen principles related to the NIWA or Japanese garden."Dr. Lennoc Tierney” appears
                                in the upper right corner of the screen for a few seconds.

                                The scene transitions back to the narrator, who appears briefly before the screen fades
                                to black. Then, a table titled “7 Zen Principles Related to the Niwa, or Japanese
                                Garden” appears, drawn in white lines. The seven principles—Yu-gen, Shizen, Kanso,
                                Fukinsei, Koko, Datsuzoku, and Seijaku—are listed vertically.

                                the narrator says:"All of these concepts are interdependent, which means they're they
                                feed off of each other, so no one Japanese philosophy can be used to sum up the Japanese
                                garden. The more we can familiarize ourselves with these Zen concepts, the deeper the
                                appreciation we can have for the Japanese garden."

                                Finally, the narrator appears once more on screen, continuing his explanation with
                                expressive hand gestures. Gradually, the screen begins to crossfade to black, bringing
                                the video to a gentle close.

                                the narrator says: "Ultimately, this leads to a deeper experience we can have in the
                                garden, where the lines between humans and nature gets blurred."

                        <p><strong>In Budapest</strong>, <strong>Japanese gardens</strong> serve as a symbol of the
