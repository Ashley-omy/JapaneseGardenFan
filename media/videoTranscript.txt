The video begins with serene piano music playing in the background, as beautiful, lush green Japanese gardens come into view. The camera gently pans across moss-covered stones, carefully trimmed shrubs, and a quiet pond reflecting the surrounding trees. The scene conveys a peaceful, harmonious atmosphere.

After a few moments, the screen transitions to an indoor setting where a male narrator appears. He begins to speak in a calm and informative tone, introducing the philosophy and design principles behind Japanese gardens.

A few seconds after the narrator begins to speak, text appears in the upper right corner of the screen. It reads: "Joshua Minier, PhD – Shizen Style". The text remains visible for several seconds before fading out, providing viewers with the name and credentials of the speaker.

the narrator says:"NIWA, or Japanese garden, actually means pure place. It's meant to represent a pure and beautiful place that you can always come to, regardless of what chaotic things are going on in the world, or what your busy life is like.

The scene transitions to a traditional Japanese house, focusing on a wooden corridor that opens onto an inner courtyard. In the center lies a beautifully maintained karesansui (dry landscape) garden.

The seven principles—Yu-gen, Shizen, Kanso, Fukinsei, Koko, Datsuzoku, and Seijaku—are listed vertically.

the narrator says:"All of these concepts are interdependent, which means they're they feed off of each other, so no one Japanese philosophy can be used to sum up the Japanese garden. The more we can familiarize ourselves with these Zen concepts, the deeper the appreciation we can have for the Japanese garden."

Finally, the narrator appears once more on screen, continuing his explanation with expressive hand gestures. Gradually, the screen begins to crossfade to black, bringing the video to a gentle close.

the narrator says: "Ultimately, this leads to a deeper experience we can have in the garden, where the lines between humans and nature gets blurred."
