# Japanese Garden Fan 🌿

This is my submission for the **Web Development** course (Course Code: `IP-18fWF1EG`) at **ELTE**.

## 🌟 Why is this website user-friendly?

This website was built with accessibility and usability in mind. Here are some features that make it user-friendly:

- ✅ **Screen Reader Friendly**  
  Users can skip repeated content (like headers) using built-in accessibility features. All images are provided with `alt` attributes that include concise descriptions.

- 🔠 **Adjustable Font Size**  
  Implemented using JavaScript, allowing users to change the font size for better readability.

- 📱 **Responsive Design**  
  The layout adapts to different screen sizes — mobile, tablet, or desktop.

- 🖼️ **Linked Full-Size Images**  
  On the **"Find Gardens"** page, every image is linked to its original full-size version for better viewing.

> ⚠️ **Note**:  
> The photos currently used have been replaced with free stock images for publishing this as part of my portfolio. They are **not related** to the actual gardens listed on the website.
